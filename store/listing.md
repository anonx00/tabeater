## Extension Name
TabEater

## Short Description (132 characters max)
AI-powered tab manager. Smart grouping, duplicate detection, and Auto-Pilot mode to organize tabs automatically. Privacy-focused.

## Detailed Description

Stop drowning in tabs. Start focusing.

TabEater is the minimalist, AI-powered assistant that keeps your browser clean automatically. Unlike other managers that require manual sorting, TabEater's Auto-Pilot organizes your workspace in the background as you browse—so you never have to "manage" your tabs again.

Designed with a native, distraction-free interface, it feels like a natural part of your browser.

KEY FEATURES

Auto-Pilot Mode
Set it and forget it. As you open new links, TabEater instantly analyzes and moves them into smart groups (like "Work," "Research," or "Social"). Your browser stays organized without you lifting a finger. Choose from three modes: Manual, Auto-Cleanup (closes stale/duplicate tabs), or Fly-Mode (continuous auto-grouping).

Smart Duplicate Cleanup
Intelligent deduplication that actually works. TabEater finds duplicate tabs but smartly preserves your active or most recent version, clearing out the clutter while keeping your work safe.

Action-First Dashboard
No complex charts or confusing data. Just clear actions: Organize, Deduplicate, and Analyze. Get back to "Inbox Zero" for your tabs in seconds.

Tab Health & Memory Tracking
Real-time health scoring for your browser. See which tabs are using the most memory, identify stale tabs you haven't touched in days, and get actionable insights to optimize your browsing.

AI-Powered Intelligence
Ask questions about your tabs in natural language. Get intelligent insights and suggestions for organization. Summarize any tab's content with one click.
