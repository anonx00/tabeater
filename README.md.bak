# PHANTOM TABS - Tactical Tab Intelligence System

**PHANTOM TABS** is an AI-powered Chrome Extension designed for high-efficiency tab management. It utilizes local AI (Gemini Nano) as the primary intelligence engine to categorize, prioritize, and summarize your browsing session, with a cloud fallback (Groq Llama 3) for robust reliability.

## 🎯 Mission Objectives

- **Cost Efficiency**: Primary intelligence runs locally on-device (Gemini Nano) for $0 cost and maximum privacy.
- **Tactical UI**: Dark, military-inspired interface for focused operations.
- **Automated Intel**: Auto-grouping and prioritization of tabs based on content analysis.

## 🛠️ Installation (Developer Mode)

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/phantom-tabs.git
   cd phantom-tabs
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the Project**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This will generate a `dist` folder containing the compiled extension.

4. **Load into Chrome**
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
   - Enable **Developer mode** (top right toggle).
   - Click **Load unpacked**.
   - Select the `dist` directory from the project folder.

## 🧠 AI Configuration

### Primary: Gemini Nano (Local)
This extension relies on Chrome's built-in AI capabilities.
- Ensure you are using a compatible version of Chrome (Canary/Dev may be required).
- Enable "Prompt API for Gemini Nano" in `chrome://flags`.

### Fallback: Groq (Cloud)
If local AI is unavailable, the system falls back to a Google Cloud Function proxying to Groq.
- The cloud backend is designed to scale to zero to minimize costs.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

- `extension/`: Chrome Extension source code (React, TypeScript).
- `cloud-functions/`: Serverless backend for AI proxying.
- `infrastructure/`: Terraform configurations for GCP deployment.
- `.github/workflows/`: CI/CD pipelines.
